# GuessNumberSFML
This is the homework given to the class. The task is to make a "simple" game that asks you to write a number, and the game says if your are "cold", "warm" or "hot"

### Extra info
Of course, I wasn't going to make a "simple game", that would be way to easy; that's  why I decided to implement a GUI with some animations (Refer to the repository "AnimsSFML").

### What I need:
Just a console game. You write a number between 0 and 100 and the game says "cold", "warm" or "hot" depending on how near you were to the number.

### What I want:
Fuck the class and everything there. In my game there will be a title constatly tilting. There has to be a grid showing the numbers: if you click one and its wrong, a cross is put over it and the screen freezes/burns acording to how near you were
